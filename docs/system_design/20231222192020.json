{"Implementation approach": "We will utilize Python to create the 2048 game, focusing on simplicity and usability. For the core game mechanics, we'll use numpy for efficient array manipulation. The leaderboard will be implemented using SQLite to store player scores, which provides a lightweight database solution without the need for a separate server. The user interface will be built using tkinter for its simplicity and wide support.
