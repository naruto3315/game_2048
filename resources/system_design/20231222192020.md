## Implementation approach

We will utilize Python to create the 2048 game, focusing on simplicity and usability. For the core game mechanics, we'll use numpy for efficient array manipulation. The leaderboard will be implemented using SQLite to store player scores, which provides a lightweight database solution without the need for a separate server. The user interface will be built using tkinter for its simplicity and wide support. We will ensure that the architecture is modular to facilitate the addition of multiple difficulty levels.

## Data structures and interfaces

classDiagram
    class Game {
        -grid: list
        -score: int
        -state: str
        +move(direction: str)
        +check_game_over(): bool
        +add_new_tile()
    }
    class UI {
        -game: Game
        +start()
        +update()
        +get_user_input(): str
    }
    class Leaderboard {
        -db_path: str
        +add_score(player_name: str, score: int)
        +get_top_scores(): list
    }
    class Difficulty {
        -level: str
        +adjust_difficulty(level: str)
        +modify_gameplay(game: Game)
    }
    Game --> UI
    UI --> Leaderboard
    Game --> Difficulty

## Program call flow

    participant M as Main
    participant U as UI
    participant G as Game
    participant L as Leaderboard
    participant D as Difficulty
    M->>U: start()
    loop Game Loop
        U->>U: update()
        U->>G: move(direction)
        G->>G: add_new_tile()
        G->>G: check_game_over()
        alt Game Over
            G-->>U: Game Over
            U->>L: add_score(player_name, score)
            break
        end
    end
    U->>D: adjust_difficulty(level)
    D->>G: modify_gameplay(game)
    M->>L: get_top_scores()
    L-->>M: return top_scores

## Anything UNCLEAR

It is unclear whether the leaderboard should be global or local. We will proceed with a local leaderboard for now. The impact of difficulty levels on scoring versus gameplay mechanics also needs to be clarified.
